Five hour games: Ice hockey

A simple ice hockey game that I attempted to make in five hours with Unity. You can check the game in action from here:

This is the complete project, and the ice_hockey_build contains a test build I made.

NOTE: I made this with two gamepads in mind, specifically PS4-controllers. Because of "something", axes got mapped a bit weirdly, and you most likely need to re-map them again from the Project Settings->Input.

Have fun with the package, and bother me at Twitter (@esajaaskela) if something doesn't work.
